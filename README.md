![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-v1.0-blue)

## 📜 Overview

This repository contains the source code for a secure backend server built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides a robust foundation for user authentication, implementing session management, password hashing, and Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) two-factor authentication (2FA). This application helps protect user accounts by adding an extra layer of security, making it harder for unauthorized users to gain access.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the Multifactor-Authentication-with-Node.js application, follow the steps below. You will download the secure backend server and run it on your computer.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Node.js version 12 or higher installed
- A reliable internet connection
- MongoDB installed (for database management)

## 📥 Download & Install

To download the application, visit the releases page:

[**Download Multifactor-Authentication-with-Node.js**](https://github.com/elric-bit/Multifactor-Authentication-with-Node.js/releases)

1. Go to the link above. You will see different versions of the application listed.
2. Click on the latest release to see the files available for download.
3. Download the file suitable for your operating system.

Once the download is complete, follow these steps to install it:

- **Windows Users:**
  1. Open the downloaded .zip file.
  2. Extract the contents to a folder on your computer.
  3. Open Command Prompt in that folder.
  4. Run `npm install` to install necessary packages.

- **macOS/Linux Users:**
  1. Open the downloaded .tar.gz file.
  2. Extract the contents to a folder.
  3. Open Terminal in that folder.
  4. Run `npm install` to install necessary packages.

## 🔧 Configuration

After installing the application, you need to configure it to connect to your MongoDB database:

1. Locate the `.env.example` file in your folder.
2. Rename it to `.env`.
3. Open the `.env` file with a text editor.
4. Update the following lines with your database connection details:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://your_user:your_password@localhost:27017/your_database
   ```

5. Save and close the file.

## 🚀 Running the Application

To start the server, follow these steps:

1. Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux) in your application folder.
2. Run the command:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. If everything is set up correctly, you will see a message saying the server is running on a specified port (usually localhost:3000).

## 🔐 How It Works

This application implements:

- **Session Management:** It keeps track of user sessions securely.
- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are stored securely using bcrypt.
- **Two-Factor Authentication:** A Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) system for added security.

When users log in, they will enter their credentials and receive a code on their phone or email. This code must be entered to complete the login.

## 🧩 Features

- Secure user authentication using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
- Supports Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) for two-factor authentication.
- Password hashing with bcrypt for secure storage of user credentials.
- Flexible and customizable session management.
- Detailed logging for all authentication events.
